                  RADCOM collaborated with{" "}
                  <b>STB (Societatea de Transport Bucure»ôti</b>), the public
                  transportation operator in Bucharest, to implement a fully

                  the <b>OptiFare e-ticketing system</b>, which streamlined fare
                  collection and allowed passengers to easily purchase and
                  validate tickets through mobile apps, contactless cards, and
                  vending machines. Additionally, RADCOM deployed the{" "}
